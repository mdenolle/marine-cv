    abstract = {Seismology has entered the petabyte era, driven by decades of continuous recordings of broadband networks, the increase in nodal seismic experiments, and the recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). This review explains how cloud platforms, by providing object storage, elastic compute, and managed databases, enable researchers to “bring the code to the data,” thereby providing a scalable option to overcome traditional HPC solutions’ bandwidth and capacity limitations. After literature reviews of cloud concepts and their research applications in seismology, we illustrate the capacities of cloud-native workflows using two canonical end-to-end demonstrations: 1) ambient noise seismology that calculates cross-correlation functions at scale, and 2) earthquake detection and phase picking. Both workflows utilize Amazon Web Services, a commercial cloud platform for streaming I/O and provenance, demonstrating that cloud throughput can rival on-premises HPC at comparable costs, scanning 100 TBs to 1.3 PBs of seismic data in a few hours or days of processing. The review also discusses research and education initiatives, the reproducibility benefits of containers, and cost pitfalls (e.g., egress, I/O fees) of energy-intensive seismological research computing. While designing cloud pipelines remains non-trivial, partnerships with research software engineers enable converting domain code into scalable, automated, and environmentally conscious solutions for next-generation seismology. We also outline where cloud resources fall short of specialised HPC-most notably for tightly coupled petascale simulations and long-term, PB-scale archives-so that practitioners can make informed, cost-effective choices.},

We present the experience of conducting training workshops in various forms of delivery to support the adoption of large‐scale high‐performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing, advancing seismological research. The seismological foci were on earthquake source parameter estimation in catalogs, forward and adjoint wavefield simulations in 2D and 3D at local, regional, and global scales, earthquake dynamics, ambient noise seismology, and machine learning. This contribution describes the series of workshops delivered as part of research projects, the learning outcomes for participants, and lessons learned by the instructors. Our curriculum was grounded on open and reproducible science, large‐scale scientific computing and data mining, and computing infrastructure (access and usage) for HPC and the cloud. We also describe the types of teaching materials that have proven beneficial to the instruction and the sustainability of the program. We propose guidelines to deliver future workshops on these topics.},

Current data formats and computing infrastructure are not well‐adapted or user‐friendly for large‐scale processing. We propose an innovative, cloud‐native solution for DAS seismology using the MinIO open‐source object storage framework. We develop data schema for cloud‐optimized data formats—Zarr and TileDB, which we deploy on a local object storage service compatible with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage system. We benchmark reading and writing performance for various data schema using canonical use cases in seismology. We test our framework on a local server and AWS. We find much‐improved performance in compute time and memory throughout when using TileDB and Zarr compared to the conventional HDF5 data format. We demonstrate the platform with a computing heavy use case in seismology: ambient noise seismology of DAS data. We process one month of data, pairing all 2089 channels within 24 hr using AWS Batch autoscaling.},
