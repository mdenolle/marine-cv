  - 'My advising experience includes research opportunities, such as summer programs or independent studies conducted during the academic year. During the academic year, students enroll in 499 for a few credits to continue their research with me. On breaks or during the summer, I provide them with hourly pay. Note: (*) Resulted in a presentation at a national conference. (**) Resulted in a peer-reviewed publication. (***) In-prep for peer-reviewed publication. (+) Students received a GRFP with my letters written based on our collaborative research.'
